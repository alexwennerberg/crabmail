TODO
====

Move from mailparse to mail-parser
    - This will simplify a lot of the code, as mail-parser has a better API IMO
      and a lot of helper functions to do things I need
    - This should also make the "raw mail" export actually work

Rewrite thread builder
    - See src/threading for more info. Consider algorithm specified there, or
      jwz threading

Duplicate ID verification: warn on duplicate ID, use first received-date. This
is to prevent someone overwriting old emails secretly 

Add replies as well as parents
    - Note that unfortunately a lot of clients don't parse the in-reply-to
      header. Maybe there is a non-sucky workaround

Color highlight on anchor select

Move from horrowshow -> nanotemplate

Refactor so there is a better interface with the filesystem, which then
will let me do some caching stuff

Maybe
=====
Allow Mbox
    - why not? -> "Do one thing and do it well". Use mblaze for mbox conversion. 
Take a list of folders rather than a single top-level folder
    - maybe cleaner API
