# ðŸ¦€CrabmailðŸ¦€

A static mail HTML archive for the 21st century, written in Rust. Includes
helpful "modern" features that existing solutions lack, like:

* Responsive UI
* Single-page threads
* Working mailto: links
* Thread-based Atom feeds

Not implemented yet / designed:
* Attachment handling?
* Gemini support

EMAIL FOREVER!
