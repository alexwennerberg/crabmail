# crabmail

A static mail HTML archive for the 21st century, written in Rust. Includes helpful "modern" features that existing solutions lack, like:

* Responsive UI
* Single-page threads
* Working mailto: links
* Thread-based Atom feeds

EMAIL FOREVER!

For project discussion and patches, use the [Mailing list](https://lists.flounder.online/crabmail/)

Crabmail is AGPLv3 licenses, but I'm happy to release code snippets from this
repo (which reimplements some common Rust funxtions) in a less permissive
license. Email me!
