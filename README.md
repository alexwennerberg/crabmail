# crabmail

Simple, readonly mailing list archive.

An html mail archive, written in Rust. Similar to [Hypermail](https://github.com/hypermail-project/hypermail).

## Why?

Despite decades of technological development, mailing lists persist as part of
the internet's infrastructure. Projects such as python, Go, postgresql, Linux,
etc, all rely on self-hosted mailing lists for their development. Mailing lists
are stable, persistent, and open to all. If you use a mailing list, you don't
have to worry about a platform closing, removing a key feature, or taking
actions that are against your values. Mailing lists are simple and based on
open standards, and email has enormous existing software infrastructure to
support it. Even in 2021, for many use cases, there exists no better
alternative to email and mailing lists.

Unfortunately, mailing lists have fallen out of popularity, and many people are
trying to reinvent solutions to problems that mailing lists already solve. In
my view, the problem is that, in many cases, there aren't very many good,
modern options for mailing list software. Existing mailing list archives are
extremely old, largely unmaintained, and lack certain key features. More
"modern" mailing lists, like Discourse, are enormously complex and dificult to
self-host. Crabmail is built for simplicity, ease of hosting, and longevity.


THIS IS VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT!
