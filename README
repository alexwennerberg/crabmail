ðŸ¦€CrabmailðŸ¦€
===========

A static mail HTML archive for the 21st century, written in Rust. Includes
helpful "modern" features that existing solutions lack, like:

* Responsive UI
* Single-page threads
* Working mailto: links
* Thread-based Atom feeds

Not implemented yet / designed:
* Attachment handling?
* Gemini support

EMAIL FOREVER!

Install and usage
=================

(DRAFT) see https://alex.flounder.online/tech/howtolist.gmi for more detail

git clone https://git.alexwennerberg.com/crabmail/
cd crabmail && cargo install --path .

Copy crabmail.conf and set the variables as needed.  

Run crabmail [maildir root] -c [config-file.conf].

If you want to use an mbox, use https://github.com/leahneukirchen/mblaze to
import it into a maildir. Mblaze also has some tools that you may find
supplementary to crabmail.

Crabmail is AGPLv3 licenses, but I'm happy to release code snippets from this
repo (which reimplements some common Rust functions) in a less permissive
license. Email me!
