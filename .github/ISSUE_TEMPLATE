Before using github for this project, please consider the self-hosted mailing list instead:

https://lists.flounder.online/crabmail/

Crabmail exists, in part, to challenge GitHub monoculture and re-introduce
decentralized git workflows. I acknowledge that this workflow may seem awkward
or unfamiliar, and I will still accept issues and PRs on Github, but I would be
happier if you use the self-hosted mailing list instance, and it will provide
you with some experience using crabmail itself.
